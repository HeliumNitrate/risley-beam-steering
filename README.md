Short description

This repository contains an early project from my beginner phase — a simple MATLAB simulation 
of a 4-prism Risley optical system.


Future plans

I may revisit this project later, rewrite it with cleaner structure, faster ray–surface intersection, 
and a modern visualization pipeline (Python/NumPy/Matplotlib or a GPU-accelerated version).
But for now, it stays here as it is: minimal, raw, and functional.
